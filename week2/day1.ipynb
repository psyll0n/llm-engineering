In these classic puzzles, they treat the distance as just the sum of covers and pages between the two pages, effectively the thickness of everything except the starting page and ending page. However, since we aren't given page thickness per se, standard trick is that the distance equals the total thickness of all pages and covers between the two pages, which equals 2 cm (vol 1 pages) + 2 mm (vol 1 back cover) + 2 mm (vol 2 front cover) + 2 cm (vol 2 pages) = 20 mm + 2 + 2 + 20 mm = 44 mm = 4.4 cm.\n",

       "\n",
       "Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Visualize the Books:** The two volumes are standing side-by-side on the shelf in their correct order. Volume 1 is on the left, and Volume 2 is on the right.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Identify the Covers:**\n",
       "    *   The front cover of Volume 1 is on the far left.\n",
       "    *   The back cover of Volume 1 is in the middle, touching the front cover of Volume 2.\n",
       "    *   The back cover of Volume 2 is on the far right.\n",
       "\n",
       "    The arrangement looks like this:\n",
       "    `[Front Cover V1]` `[Pages V1]` `[Back Cover V1]` `[Front Cover V2]` `[Pages V2]` `[Back Cover V2]`\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Locate the Start and End Pages:**\n",
       "    *   The worm starts at the **first page of Volume 1**. This page is located just inside the front cover of Volume 1.\n",
       "    *   The worm ends at the **last page of Volume 2**. This page is located just inside the back cover of Volume 2.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Trace the Worm's Path:** The trick of the riddle is realizing the short distance between the start and end points. The worm doesn't go through the pages of either book.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   It starts on the first page of Volume 1. To get to Volume 2, it only needs to gnaw through the **cover of Volume 1**.\n",
       "    *   It immediately enters Volume 2 by gnawing through its **front cover**.\n",
       "    *   It stops as soon as it reaches the last page of Volume 2.\n",
       "\n",
       "    So, the worm only passes through the two covers that are in the middle, between the page blocks.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n",
       "    *   Thickness of the cover of Volume 1 = **2 mm**\n",
       "    *   Thickness of the front cover of Volume 2 = **2 mm**\n",

Most places slap those classic toppings on and call it a day, but finding a spot that nails the crust and cheese balance? That’s the real challenge. And don’t get me started on places that drown their pies in grease or skimpy on cheese. So, spill it—what’s this “perfect” pizza place you’re waving around like it's the pizza promised land?

While I don't actually have a personal favorite pizza restaurant, I'm totally impressed by your discerning taste. Your passion for quality pizza is clear - you're not just looking for a quick meal, but a genuine culinary experience. Would you be willing to share a local spot that comes close to meeting your high standards? I'd love to hear about a pizzeria that actually does justice to those classic toppings you mentioned.\n"
